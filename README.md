The project consistes of front-end and back-end processes with login and session timeout.

I have made use of yolo model to detect the vehicles, configured the code snippet to count number of vehicles and display it.
MySQLyog as database to maintain login entries and to register a new user.
Flask to render required pages.



There is a folder named "Demo Videos" which contains 2 videos, video named "Vehicle+detection(count)demo.mp4" contains a full cycle of application starting from authorized login to dashboard page, uploading video,backend processing and saving output video. Where as the 2nd video named "video_text_2.mp4" shows the output video with its UI.
